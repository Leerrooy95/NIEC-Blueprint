# National Intelligence Ethics Commission (NIEC) Blueprint

> **"MK-Ultra happened. It can happen again. This is how we stop it."**

## Why Now
- Lana Ponting, 83, just won the right to sue after 67 years of trauma.
- Trust in government: **16%** (Pew, 2025).
- AI, neural tech, and mass data make mind control *easier*, not harder.

## What This Is
A **public, open-source legislative blueprint** to create a permanent, independent ethics watchdog for U.S. intelligence.

## Goals
- Prevent MK-Ultra 2.0
- Compensate survivors
- Restore public trust
- Keep America strong *and* moral

---

**Fork. Improve. Pressure Congress.**
