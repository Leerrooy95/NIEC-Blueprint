## Why Now — A 67-Year Wound Is Finally Open

In 1958, 16-year-old Lana Ponting was drugged with LSD, subjected to electroshock, and psychologically tortured with looped audio tapes — all under **MK-Ultra**, a CIA-funded mind-control program run through front organizations and Canadian hospitals.

She just won the right to sue.  
**67 years later.**

Meanwhile:
- Public trust in government: **16%** (Pew, 2025)
- AI, neural tech, and mass data make mind control **easier**, not harder

**We don’t have another 67 years.**

## What This Is
A **public, open-source legislative blueprint** to create a permanent, independent ethics watchdog for U.S. intelligence.

## Goals
- Prevent MK-Ultra 2.0
- Compensate survivors
- Restore public trust
- Keep America strong *and* moral

---

**Fork. Improve. Pressure Congress.**
