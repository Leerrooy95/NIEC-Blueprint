# Letter to Congress: Sponsor the NIEC Act

Dear [Rep/Sen. Last Name],

I read about Lana Ponting — a 16-year-old girl drugged, shocked, and brainwashed by the CIA in 1958.  
She just won the right to sue... **67 years later**.

We **cannot** wait another lifetime for justice.

That’s why I helped draft the **National Intelligence Ethics Commission Act** — an open-source bill to:
- Audit all human-subject intelligence programs
- Compensate MK-Ultra survivors
- Prevent AI-era mind control abuses

**Please sponsor H.R. ____ and lead on ethics in intelligence.**

This isn’t left or right. It’s **right and wrong**.

Sincerely,  
Austin Smith
